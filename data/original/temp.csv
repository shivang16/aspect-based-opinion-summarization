Good but overpriced,"Samsung really needs to quit Exynos. It's better than the previous generation Exynos but still it can't match the Snapdragon. I upgraded from S9 Plus but can't see anything major except 5G, 120 Hertz refresh rate and Android 11 with OneUI 3.1 and some speed improvement obviously. But heating and battery drain issue is still there. You can't except these things to happen when you are spending over 60K. I think one should think twice before spending this much to buy an Exynos powered Samsung flagship during the first year of release. I advice you to please wait for price cut or discount if you're planning to buy. It doesn't worth more than 50K.",3,120
Great phone with legendary features and elite camera,A true flagship phone with more than a day's power. Size of the phone makes it way too handy and yet big enough to experience the high resolution graphics and photos. Camera quality is just wow because of the 8k video and 30x zoom. Value for money - the range of exclusive and elite features makes this device to take a leap ahead of the phones at this price. Color combinations are jaw dropping especially the phantom violet. Also the super fast and wireless charging support are both quick enough to make you never take a break from it. Loving it so far.,4,63
Doesn't really live upto the reputation.,Was a one plus fan uptill now. With recent developments decided to shift over to samsung. The built and looks are good for a premium mobile. However the battery poses a challenge. Seems to get drained every 7-8 hours with moderate usage. Switching on the app's such as camera heats up the mobile forcing it to close down the app. The pics quality is good but zooming in gives a grainy appearance. The resolution doesn't really match up to the promises. I don't know what to do with the battery and the heating issues. Hopefully Samsung representatives shall be able to point out the solution.,2,50
Bad camera,Camera quality is not good. It is mentioned as 13mp but the motion of the camera is like 2mp. Phone is very slow in operation even though it is 3gb RAM . More over it is MADE IN CHINA.,1,20
